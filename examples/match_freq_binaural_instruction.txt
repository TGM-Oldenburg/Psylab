
	This psychoacoustical experiment is about the subjective match
	of tones to have equal pitch (tone height).

	In this experiment, you will hear two short tones after
	another.  One of the tones will always be the same ("reference
	tone").  The other tone ("test tone") will be different in
	pitch.  The pitch difference will be clearly perceivable in
	the beginning, and it will decrease during the course of the
	experiment, such that you may have difficulties or find it
	impossible to hear any difference.

	Your task as a test person is to adjust the pitch of the test
	tone after each presentation by using one of the answer
	buttons "up" resp. "down".  You should answer "up" if you
	think that the test tone should become higher in pitch in
	order to match the reference tone.  Likewise, by answering
	"down" you indicate that the test tone should be become lower
	in pitch in order to match the pitch of the reference tone.
	If you cannot decide, please make a guess.
