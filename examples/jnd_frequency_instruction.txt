
	This psychoacoustical experiment investigates the perception
	of DIFFERENCES in pitch (tone height), i.e. the detectability
	of an increase of the frequency of a tone.  

	In this experiment, you will hear three tone intervals after
	another.  The three intervals will be marked visually.  Two of
	the intervals will be the same while one of the intervals
	contains a tone with a higher pitch.  In each presentation of
	the intervals, the one containing the tone with higher pitch
	will be selected randomly.  The pitch difference will be
	clearly audible in some trials and really small in others
	during the course of the experiment, such that you may have
	difficulties or find it impossible to hear the difference.

	Your task as a test person is to decide, after each presentation,
	in which of the intervals (1, 2, or 3) you heard the tone with
	the higher pitch.  You can answer by clicking the corresponding
	answer button.  If you cannot decide, please make a guess.
