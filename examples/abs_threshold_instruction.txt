
	This psychoacoustical experiment investigates the
	detectability of (possibly very) soft tones.

	In this experiment, you will hear three intervals after
	another.  The three intervals will be marked visually.  Two of
	the intervals will contain only silence and one of the
	intervals contains a tone.  In each presentation of the
	intervals, the one containing the tone will be selected
	randomly.  The tone will be clearly audible in the beginning
	and it will get softer in loudness during the course of the
	experiment, such that you may have difficulties or find it
	impossible to hear the tone difference.

	Your task as a test person is to decide, after each
	presentation, which of the intervals (1, 2, or 3) contained
	the test tone.  You can answer by clicking the corresponding
	answer button.  If you cannot decide, please make a guess.
