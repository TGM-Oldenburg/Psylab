
	This psychoacoustical experiment investigates the perception
	of DIFFERENCES in loudness, i.e. the detectability of an
	increase of the sound level of a tone.

	In this experiment, you will hear two tone intervals after
	another.  The two intervals will be marked visually.  In one
	of the intervals the tone will be louder than in the other.
	In each presentation of the intervals, the one containing the
	louder tone will be selected randomly.  The loudness
	difference will be clearly audible in the beginning and it
	will become smaller during the course of the experiment, such
	that you may have difficulties or find it impossible to hear
	the difference.

	Your task as a test person is to decide, after each
	presentation, in which of the intervals (1 or 2) you heard
	the louder tone.  You can answer by clicking the corresponding
	answer button.  If you cannot decide, please make a guess.
