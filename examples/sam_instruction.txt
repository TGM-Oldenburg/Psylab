
	This psychoacoustical experiment investigates the perception
	of so-called amplitude modulations, i.e. the detectability
	of temporal changes of the amplitude of a tone.  

	In this experiment, you will hear three tone intervals after
	another.  The three intervals will be marked visually.  Two of
	the intervals will be the same while in one of the intervals
	the tone will contain an additional modulation.  In each
	presentation of the intervals, the one containing the
	modulation will be selected randomly.  The modulation will be
	clearly audible in the beginning and it will become weaker
	during the course of the experiment, such that you may have
	difficulties or find it impossible to hear the modulation.

	Your task as a test person is to decide, after each presentation, 
	in which of the intervals (1, 2, or 3) you heard the modulated
	tone.  You can answer by clicking the corresponding answer
	button.  If you cannot decide, please make a guess.
