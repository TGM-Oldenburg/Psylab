
	This psychoacoustical experiment investigates the perception
	of tones that are presented together with a background noise.
	The tones can possibly be very soft in loudness and have
	varying pitch (tone height). 

	In this experiment, you will hear three intervals after
	another.  The three intervals will be marked visually.  Two of
	the intervals will be the same and they contain only the
	noise.  One of the intervals will contain the noise and also
	the additional tone.  In each presentation of the intervals,
	the one containing the additional tone will be selected
	randomly.  The tone will be clearly audible in the beginning
	and it will become softer in loudness during the course of the
	experiment, such that you may have difficulties or find it
	impossible to hear the tone in the noise.

	Your task as a test person is to decide, after each presentation,
	in which of the intervals (1, 2, or 3) you heard the tone in
	the noise.  You can answer by clicking the corresponding
	answer button.  If you cannot decide, please make a guess.
