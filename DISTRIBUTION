************

   PSYLAB is "free software"; this means that everyone is free to
use it and free to redistribute it on certain conditions.  PSYLAB is
not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions
on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit
everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.  What is
not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing any version
of PSYLAB that they might get from you.  The precise conditions are
found in the GNU General Public License that comes with PSYLAB and also
appears in the file GNU-GPL inside this psylab package.

   One way to get a copy of PSYLAB is from someone else who has it.
You need not ask the author for permission to do so, or tell any one
else; just copy it.  If you have access to the Internet, you can get
the latest distribution version of PSYLAB from the following URL:
