     SPECIAL ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO MECHANISM
     INSIDE PSYLAB THAT WOULD PREVENT THE PRESENTATION OF TOO LOUD
     SOUND LEVELS.  IT IS THE OBLIGATION OF ANY USER OF PSYLAB TO MAKE
     SURE THAT THE GENERATED STIMULI, IN COMBINATION WITH THE OTHER
     EQUIPMENT (SOUND CARD, AMPLIFIER, HEADPHONE OR LOUDSPEAKER ETC.)
     RESULT IN THE DESIRED SOUND LEVELS.
