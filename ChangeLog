2014-04-02  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT jade-hs.de>

	* mpsy_maxreversal_check.m (mpsy_maxreversal_check):  new file
	to check for value of M.MAXREVERSAL:  In older version up to
	2.5 only the upper reversals were counted.  From version 2.6
	and higher, both upper and lower reversals are counted, and
	M.MAXREVERSAL should therefore be twice as large as earlier.
	This file serves as an automatic check for smaller value of
	M.MAXREVERSAL (<=4) in older psylab experiments.  

2014-03-18  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT jade-hs.de>

	* mpsy_det_reversal_adj_step.m: File is made obsolete.  Its
	functionality is now placed into each separate file with an
	adaptive method, like mpsy_adapt_1up_1down.m,
	mpsy_adapt_1up_2down.m, mpys_adapt_uwud.m, etc.  The reasons are:
	1) The code looks much easier in the non-general form.
	2) In case of the uwud-method, the "unsure" answer is treated
	as a "wrong" answer (go up) but is not marked by 0 or 1 in
	array M.ANSWERS
	3) From version 2.6, the counting of reversals has changed to
	count both uppper AND lower reversals.  This is now also done in
	each file for adaptive procedures.

2014-02-20  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT jade-hs.de>

	* display_psydat.m (display_psydat): fixed error for the case
	npar==1 :
npar     = size(y,2)-4;
if npar == 1,
  % hm... only 1 parameter.  Add one fake-column for par2, being
  % only zero.  this will then be the one-and-only value of par2,
  % thus yielding just 1 "unique" value, i.e. uni_par2==1, see below
  y = [y 0*y(:,end) ];
  % despite only 1 parameter, 'npar' must reflect size of matrix y
  npar = npar + 1;
  param_perm = (1:npar);   % THIS line is new
end

	* display_psydat_raw.m (display_psydat_raw):
	fix of same error as in display_psydat.m


2013-09-09  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT jade-hs.de>

	* mpsy_plot_feedback.m: changed look of plot:
	familiarization	phase is now plotted in gray and measurement
	phase in black.

2013-04-10  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT jade-hs.de>

	changed affiliation/email of all files into jade-hs.de

2012-11-23  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT jade-hs.de>

	* mpsy_intrlv_match_main.m: new file for interleaved matching
	experiments
	* mpsy_match_main.m: the earlier version used a hard-coded
	1up_1down method as the only method of matching experiment.
	This has been changed, such that the adaptive method has to be
	specified now.  This is needed in cases where, e.g., the 29.3%
	point or/and the 70.7% point for a percept like "A is louder than
	B" is desired.  Omitted specification of the method will now lead
	to an error.

2011-11-01  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT jade-hs.de>

	* mpsy_msound_present.m:
	new functionality to use msound for playback (at the
	users option).  Originally this was to overcome errors of
	"sound" in Matlab-2011 Versions.  Also, visual interval
	indication is now always possible in combination with msound,
	which is useful on non-win PCs.

	* mpsy_afc_present.m:
	added new msound functionality

	* mpsy_visual_interval_check.m:
	new file to perform checks for correct (equal) lengths of
	m_test and m_ref which are required for visual interval
	indication.  This script is now called from
	mspsy_visual_interval_indicator and from mpsy_msound_present

	* mpsy_init_run.m:
	reflected new feature of msound-playback

	* mpsy_2afc_gui.m, mpsy_2auc_gui.m, ..., mpsy_4auc_gui.m:
	all GUI answer buttons handles have changed from individual
	variable names (afc_b1, afc_b2, etc.) to an array afc_but(1),
	afc_but(2), etc.

	* mpsy_visual_interval_indicator.m:
	reflecting change of answer button handle names made this
	script simpler.

	* mpsy_check.m:
	reflected the change of answer button handle names


2009-11-10  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_intrlv_afc_main.m: same change regarding reversed order
	as in mpsy_afc_main.m and mpsy_match_main.m

	Also, applied same change in quit-mechanism as for
	mpsy_match_main.m and mpsy_afc_main.m, see 2009-11-05.

	* mpsy_match_main.m: same change as in mpsy_afc_main.m

	* mpsy_afc_main.m: new reversed order of

	eval([M.EXPNAME 'user']);   % now step 1 (was step 2)

	and

	M.VARS  = [M.VARS M.VAR];   % now step 2 (was step 1)
	M.STEPS = [M.STEPS M.STEP];

	this is in order to reflect possible changes of M.VAR by the
	user script.  For example, the user script might limit M.VAR
	to within certain boundaries, e.g., to prevent amplitude
	clipping, overmodulation, negative increments, etc.
	-- suggestion by Bj√∂rn Ohl. 


2009-11-05  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_up_down_gui.m: same fix as for mpsy_afc_gui.m

	* mpsy_afc_gui.m: explicit " M.QUIT = 1;" added to DeleteFcn
	in psylab_gui.  This is in relation to fix in mpsy_afc_main.m
	and mpsy_match_main.m

	* mpsy_afc_main.m: same fix as in mpsy_match_main.m

	* mpsy_match_main.m: improved quit-mechanism when user is
	asked whether she is ready for the next run.  Pressing RET was
	required so far.  Then matlab hangs when the GUI was deleted.
	This is now controlled for. 

2009-9-24  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_afc_gui.m: new method and new value calculated by the
	'KeyPressFcn' of the subject GUI.  The user answer is set to
	M.UA=double(get(gcf, 'CurrentCharacter'))-double('0');
	This allows direct detection of single characters, e.g. RET,
	or '-'

	* mpsy_adapt_1up_1down.m: the variables M.ADAPT_N_UP and
	M.ADAPT_N_DOWN are now set in this script.  Previously, until
	version 2.2 they had to be set in the main script of each
	experiment.  They were previously used inside mpsy_afc_main.m
	to "eval"uate which adaptive script should be run.  This has
	changed, by they are still needed for the automatic detection
	of reversal points.

	* mpsy_adapt_1up_2down.m: same as in mpsy_adapt_1up_1down
	* mpsy_adapt_2up_1down.m: same as in mpsy_adapt_1up_1down
	* mpsy_adapt_1up_3down.m: same as in mpsy_adapt_1up_1down

	* mpsy_adapt_wud.m: new file that implements the "weighted
	up-down method according to Kaernbach (1991) 

	* mpsy_adapt_uwud.m: new file that implements the "unforced
	weighted up-down method according to Kaernbach (2001)

	* mpsy_3auc_gui.m: new GUI for use with UNforced WUD method. 

	* mpsy_afc_present.m: new possible value -3 for M.ACT_ANSWER
	indication "indecision", needed by the UWUD adaptive method

	
2009-03-19  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_afc_present.m: new name chosen instead of previous name
	mpsy_present.m
	
	* mpsy_match_present.m: new file, very similar to
	mpsy_afc_present.m but suitable for matching experiments.
	ALSO:  correct typo in
	    if isempty(M.UD),  ud = -1;  end;
	into
	    if isempty(M.UD),  M.UD = -1;  end;
	now bug observation of H. Kern is solved

	* Makefile:  changes to reflect the above two new names.

	* psydat_helper.m: new small help application: make it eays to
	check through all your psydat files, and select subset of a
	subject's measured data.  This is not yet made a standard part
	of psylab.
	
	* mpsy_match_main.m: a block of lines has been removed and
	placed into mpsy_match_present.  As a result, mpsy_match_main
	and mpsy_afc_main now look extremely similar.   

2009-01-15  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_plot_result.m: minor change:  figure is only created in case
	of data to be plotted. 

	* mpsy_split_lines_to_toks.m (tok): corrected a crash problem 
	due to empty lines in psydat file by adding
             tok = {};  % to avoid crash in case of empty input
	as the first line.
	
	* display_psydat_raw.m: added same two additional input arguments
	'pstyle' and 'param_perm' as already present in display_psydat.m  

	* read_psydat.m: introduced a more informative message, including
	line_number in psydat file, in case that some lines of the psydat
	contain malformed entries.

2008-11-04  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_info.m: added check for existence of handles before setting
	any of the text fields.  This is necessary in case that the AFC
	GUI was deleted.

	* mpsy_up_down_gui.m (psylab_gui): added same 'DeleteFcn' as in
	mpsy_afc_gui.m

	* mpsy_afc_gui.m (psylab_gui): added a 'DeleteFcn' property to the
	AFC-GUI which allows a smooth stop of a current psylab run. 

2008-11-03  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_plot_feedback.m : bug fix: first run with M.DEBUG > 0
	crashed due to non-existent variable "measurement_fidx" when text
	information about median, mean and std.dev. should be diplayed

2008-02-01  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT fh-oldenburg.de>
	
	* Makefile changed to reflect new directories/names
	
	* New name "examples" for previous subdir "exp"
	
	* Introduction of new subdirectory "contrib".  First
	members of that directory are:
	1) melody recognition experiment, provided by A.Baumgart & S.Franz 
           based on reference Akeroyd et al. 2001
	2) huggins pitch detection/discrimintaion experiment, provided by G. Stiefenhofer
           based on reference Santurette & Dau 2007

	* mpsy_plot_feedback.m (legend): added text information about
	median, mean and std.dev. to plot 

	* mpsy_proto.m (m_filenamedate): changed behaviour when saving
	data in binary matlab format.  Save only once into filename with
	name consisting of subject name, current date (and current hour)

	* mpsy_proto.m: added check for new flag-variable M.SAVEMEAN.  If
	M.SAVEMEAN is set, it specifies that the MEAN of all values of
	M.VAR during the measurement phase should be taken as the final
	threshold value, rather than the MEDIAN -- as has been the psylab
	standard up to now.  Provided by Sven Franz.
	
	(M.ALLTHRES_MEAN): new variable which holds the collection of all
	threshold MEANs - similar to already existing M.ALLTHRES_MED

	* rms.m: added/corrected text for verbose information about RMS
	value in case of multi-column input signals.

	* test_adaptive_rule.m: new file to test adaptive up-down-rules

	* mpsy_check.m: slight rearrangement of checks.  Corrected check
	for strings that must not contain empty spaces.

	* mpsy_1up_3down.m: new file for 1up-3down method.  Provided by Christian Bartsch

2007-07-09  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* display_psydat_raw.m (figure(200)): removed explicit figure number
	200 for plotting.  

	* display_psydat.m (figure(200)): removed explicit figure number
	200 for plotting.  

2007-05-24  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_init_run.m: check for computer operating system.  Reset
	M.VISUAL_INDICATOR to 0 if not on a windows PC system. 

	* mpsy_present.m: added check for computer operating system: only
	add an explicit pause after sound on windows PC systems.

2007-04-17  Martin Hansen  <psylab AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_intrlv_afc_main.m: new file for running experiment with
	interleaved tracks

	* mpsy_intrlv_init.m: new file for intializing interleaved tracks

	* mpsy_intrlv_gettrack.m: new file for finding next running track
	at random, and for putting a copy of that tracks data in MI into
	variable M

	* mpsy_intrlv_puttrack.m: new file for putting current tracks' M
	back into array MI

2007-04-16  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_simu_main.m:  added 'figure(111)' prior to call to mpsy_plot_feedback
	* mpsy_match_main.m: added 'figure(111)' prior to call to mpsy_plot_feedback
	* mpsy_afc_main.m:   added 'figure(111)' prior to call to mpsy_plot_feedback

2007-03-29  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_afc_main.m: changed order of informaton about next run and
	asking subject whether to start the next run. 

	* mpsy_present.m: new file that contains mounting and presentatino
	of n-AFC intervals, and subsequent processing of user answer.

	changed all occurrences of 'ua'  (user answer)
	into M.UA
	
	changed all occurrences of 'ud'  (up-down user answer)
	into M.UD

2007-03-12  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_plot_feedback.m: changed so that current plot of M.VARS is
	only append to file "plots_mvars_M.SNAME" in case M.DEBUG>1

2007-01-04  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_visual_interval_indicator.m (dur_interval): check for equal
	length of m_test and m_ref resp. m_ref1 and m_ref2.  Issue warning
	about setting M.VISUAL_INDICATOR = 0 in that case.
	Check for existence of m_ref vs. m_ref1. 

	* mpsy_init_run.m: now also m_test and m_ref* are getting
	cleared here. 

	* mpsy_afc_main.m: changed call to mpsy_nafc from function-like to
	script-like.

	* mpsy_nafc_singleref.m: new name for previous file mpsy_nafc.m
	This file handles N-AFC experiments with one single-reference,
	stored in 'm_ref' - as was the one-and-only possibility prior to
	psylab version 1.97.

	* mpsy_nafc.m: changed from a function to a script, allowing
	EITHER a single-reference interval 'm_ref' OR different reference
	interval 'm_ref1', 'm_ref2' (and 'm_ref3', if applicable).  This
	is necessary for truely random presentations of noises within one
	trial.

2006-11-29  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_init_run.m: added M.DIRECTION = [] so that 2up1down
	etc. can work correctly if the very first answer is wrong.
	1up2down was not affected, because the if-expression in line 61 in
	mpsy_1up_2down.m was already determined as 'false' due to first
	argument of the logical '&'.  

2006-11-27  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* display_psydat.m: added new optional parameter param_perm.  It
	allows to permutate the order of experiment parameters for
	plotting purposes.  The permutation is performed after data have
	been read via read_psydat.m.  The xlabel and legend(s) are also
	adapted accordingly.  The argument param_perm must be a
	permutation of (1:npar), which is the natural order of parameters
	as found in the psydat file.

	* mpsy_plot_data.m (npar): fixed an error in line 85:
	correct:    for k=1:lengt(uni_par2)
	wrong:      for k=1:size(uni_par2,1)


2006-11-22  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_plot_data.m (par2): fixed an error in line 70:
	correct:            par2 = par(:,2:npar);
	previously wrong:   par2 = par(:,npar);

	* mpsy_plot_data.m: fixed a problem occuring from a Matlab
	stupidity: Matlab has stupidly changed the way how handles are
	assigned to errorbar-plots between its versions 6 and 7.  ARGH!!
	This is now caught by a query for the matlab version release
	string.

	* display_psydat.m: added 3rd (optional) argument pstyle which is
	passed on to mpsy_plot_data.m 

2006-11-01  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* read_psydat.m (nparam): determination of nparam now only if
	correct match for experiment name is found.

	* mpsy_match_main.m: new file for controlling matching experiments
	where a test signal and a reference signal are presented and the
	subject is requested to match a signal property by answering "up" or
	"down" which will then be used to adjust the test signal.  Takes
	the equivalent role as mpsy_afc_main.m for n-AFC experiments. 

	* mpsy_match.m: new file for mounting test signal, reference
	signal, and quiet signals together for matching type experiments.
	Takes the equivalent role as file mpsy_nafc.m for n-AFC experiments.

	* mpsy_check.m: added a check for psylab version used in the
	current experiment, via checking existence of variable M_PARAM,
	indicating version 1, instead of M.PARAM, indicating version 2.

	removed old check of signal named m_ruhe

	added check for type of experiment (n-AFC vs. matching experiment) and
        corresponding error message if both fiels NAFC and MATCH_ORDER are specified

	added automated choice of correct GUI (AFC vs. Up/Down)
	corresponding to experiment type
	
	* mpsy_init_run.m: added checks and default values for fields
	VISUAL_INDICATOR, INFO, FEEDBACK, DEBUG


2006-10-25  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_info.m: new file for presenting information to the subject,
	either via commandline or via GUI.

	* mpsy_init.m: old file name for new functionality: This script is
	called once at the beginning of a (new) experiment.  It clears the
	main psylab variable M and then sets a few variables to their
	starting value.  
	This script should be called by the user within her experimen'#s
	main script as the very first action, prior to assigning the
	psylab variables M.* 

	* mpsy_init_run.m: new name for functionality of previous file
	name mpsy_init.m.  This script is called automatically by
	mpsy_afc_main.m once before each new run.  It resets all variable
	pertaining to the control of one experimental run.

2006-10-22  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_proto_v1.m: updated mpsy_proto.m to new psydat format
	version 2.  Previvous file now changed to mpsy_proto_v1.m
	
	* read_psydat_v1.m: updated read_psydat.m to new psydat format
	version 2. Previvous file now changed to read_psydat_v1.m

	* mpsy_check_psydat_version.m: new function for determining format
	of psydat file.  A new file with a version 2 header is produced,
	if filename doesn't exist yet. 

2006-10-20  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_varhighlimit.m: removed this file from being part of psylab,
	by excluding it in file list in Makefile. 

	* mpsy_varlowlimit.m: removed this file from being part of psylab,
	by excluding it in file list in Makefile. 

	* mpsy_plot_result.m: updated for new plotting with >=2 parameters

	* mpsy_plot_data.m: updated data sorting via call to unique() and
	legend formatting for new plotting with >=2 parameters in
	M.ALLPARAM

	function has new argument "pstyle".

	new psylab variable M.RESULTSTYLE, determines style of plotting
	threshold data.  can be used as argument for mpsy_plot_data.m 


2006-10-19  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_proto.m (max_thres): new format for accumulating data in
	M.ALLTHRES_MED and M.ALLTHRES_STD (column vectors) and for
	M.ALLPARAM (matrix with M.NUM_PARAMS columns and same number of
	rows as M.ALLTRES_MED and M.ALLTHRES_STD).  This format is
	expected in mpsy_plot_data.m 

	* mpsy_check.m (mpsy_must_not_be_empty): new check for length of
	M.PARAM.  Removed previous check for scalar size of variables
	named in variable "mpsy_must_be_numeric"

	* mpsy_global.m: new names M.ALLTHRES_MED and M.ALLTHRES_STD insted
	old M.ALLTRHES and M.ALLTHSD.  changed all occurences throughout
	psylab.

	IMPORTANT CHANGE: new name M.ALLPARAM instead old M.ALLPAR1 and               <------ !!!
	M.ALLPAR2 

	IMPORTANT CHANGE: all variables for the second parameter, like                <------ !!!
	"M.PAR2*", are now deprecated in psylab version 2.  Instead, a
	deliberate number of multiple parameters is now possible by making
	M.PARAM a (row) vector, where column number corresponds to
	parameter number.  names and units of parameter are stored in
	M.PARAMNAME and M.PARAMUNIT.  The number of individual parameters
	needs to be specified in NEW variable M.NUM_PARAMS


2006-10-11  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_global.m: new version 1.95, branch towards 2.0
	
	  IMPORTANT CHANGE: changed ALL variables M_* into being struct               <------ !!!
	  member fields of only one variable M, e.g. M_VAR became M.VAR
	  
	  changed variable name of field ADAPT_M_DOWN into ADAPT_N_DOWN               <------ !!!
	  throughout all files of psylab.

	* mpsy_check.m (mpsy_must_be_cell): M.PARAMNAME and M.PARAMUNIT
	must now be cells of strings, but this needs no checking in this
	file, as each element is subjected to conversion by char() (e.g. in
	mpsy_proto).


2006-03-19  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* display_psydat.m (yl): added units to par2 in legend, added
	par2name to title
	
2006-03-10  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* Makefile: Larger reorganisation of the Makefile.  Allow for
	zip/tar including the leading base-directory

	* doc/Makefile: Reorganisation for making of documentation.

2006-03-01  Martin Hansen  <martin.hansen AT fh-oldenburg.de>

	* mpsy_2up_1down.m: same corresponding rewrite as in mpsy_1up_2down.m

	* mpsy_1up_1down.m: same corresponding rewrite as in mpsy_1up_2down.m

	* mpsy_1up_2down.m: changed from function into script.  Rewrite to
	reflect new order of M_ACT_ANSWER being appended to M_ANSWERS (see
	also changes in mpsy_afc_main.m)

	* mpsy_debug.m: added new plot of reversal points into plot of M_VAR

	* mpsy_det_reversal_adj_step.m: new script to detect reversals and
