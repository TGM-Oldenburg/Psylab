
Installation
************

psylab is easy to install:  Extract all files in the psylab
distribution to some directory in your file system, say C:/home/some/place.
Then start matlab and ADD TO YOUR PATH THE DIRECTORY WHERE ALL THE
FILES NAMED 'mpsy_*.m' RESIDE.  Depending on version of psylab, this
could for example be C:/home/some/place/psylab-2.6   -- and you are done.
You should save that path for future Matlab sessions.   

psylab was tested to work with several Matlab versions from 6.5 through R2016a
on a Windows7 as well as on Linux/Ubuntu system, and partly on MacOS.

Feedback about experience with psylab from other computer systems is very
welcome.
