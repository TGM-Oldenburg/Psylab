# Psylab
psylab is a collection of scripts, written in Matlab, for designing and controlling interactive psychoacoustical listening experiments in a uniform and quick manner.

Currently, $n$-AFC detection and discrimination experiments ($n$=2,3,4) and 2-AFC matching experiments are readily supported.  The stimulus variable can either be controlled adaptively according to $x$-up-$y$-down algorithms ($x,y \in \{1,2,3\})$) and weighted-up-down algorithms.  Alternatively, the method of constant stimuli may be used for detection and discrimination experiments.

psylab is based on many ideas of the programs 'SI/SISG' which were written at ``Drittes Physikalisches Institut'', Universität Göttingen, during the years 1989 to 1991, and which were distributed under GNU General Public License (GNU~GPL).

psylab is regularly used for education and research at Institut für Hörtechnik und Audiologie (IHA), Jade Hochschule in Oldenburg, Germany.

One aim of psylab has been to provide the students in the psychoacoustic courses with a uniform and simple starting point for designing one's own listening experiments.  So far, roughly +400 students at IHA have used psylab in their psychoacoustics assignments, for designing and carrying out individual listening experiments.  Their experience and comments have continuously contributed to new features and bug fixes of psylab.
